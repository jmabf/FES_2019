# FollowSteps
FollowSteps is a project made to change the way of collecting data and tracking the customers of your business. Using pressure plates underneath the ground we can make a heat map that shows the most frequented areas in your store. That way, the owner can look at that areas and re-map the way that the products are distribuited.
